You need this robust \nframe to support the tension. These are just taper pins, just friction \nholds them in, so you have to keep them tight. When tuning using strings\n of other materials – whether its gut or nylon, carbon fiber modern \nmaterials, or horse hair if you’re talking old strings – they stretch a \nlot. So you can give a good turn and bring up the string a little bit. \nWith metal strings the opposite is true, so you need to turn the pins \nonly a little bit at a time. You need strength for this kind of tuning, \nso using the typically stronger right hand is good.

Can you talk about a few other \nfertile areas you see for research and experimentation more generally?"] [:br {}] "\nSure. One area is the relationship between the early Irish harp and the \nMunster poets. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston – it’s a long \nstory which doesn’t fit here, an amazing story – they got money for a \nproject, and decided to build a really good museum quality playing \nreplica of the Bunworth harp. It was originally made by a John \nKelly in 1734 for the Reverend Charles Bunworth of Baltdaniel. And I\n was honoured to play it – the replica – in a performance on stage with \nthe real Bunworth harp. And I got to hold and be with the real Bunworth \nharp as well. I worked with Dave Kortier in measuring it. It is all of \nwillow. So it was really well studied. They did X-ray but they didn’t do\n CT scans, and there is MRI work which I think could be done."] "\n" [:p {} "Anyway, the Reverand Charles Bunworth befriended the harpers, and \nwhen harpers were old and couldn’t travel and were dying, they left \ntheir harps with him. After Bunworth died and the family were off in \nCork, it is reported some stupid servant burned the harps for firewood. \nThey were kept in the granary and it is possible they were very \nworm-eaten. But think of the Munster poets, and their heavy heavy duty \nJacobite poetry. And here is the Reverend Bunworth, and his harp at the \nMFA is a total Jacobite symbol. We don’t have the repertoire he played \nbut we know his position. He presided over the Bardic conferences \n every three years, and it went on for thirty years. He would have \nhad Latin and Irish, even though he was a Church of England, an Anglican\n minister."] "\n" [:p {} "So I think Munster poetry is great to fit to this music. Bunworth was\n right there, with Ó Bruadair and poets like that – he was their \nneighbour and friend. The Munster poets are really interesting, because \nsyllabic poetry survived quite late there, and they were trying to \ncontinue on even though they had to work as farm labourers as they \ncarried on their art form. Then you had mixes of syllabic poetry and " [:em {} "amhrán"] "\n in one piece, and that’s really interesting – like in the last line or \nverse. And trying to connect those forms. Coming afresh to this I think \nis really valuable to target areas that are really different from each \nother and also areas when things cross. And you have to see what you \ncome up with. It’s really fertile ground!"] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Are there any manuscripts or printed sources you feel deserve wider attention?"] [:br {}] "\nPeople pay attention to the John &amp; William Neal Collection of the \nMost Celebrated Irish Tunes, published in 1724.

The Latin language really \nasked for a different kind of music than what the Brittonic asked for. \nAnd the Brittonic was more like what we were doing with a piece of " [:em {} "rosc"] "\n poetry in what was essentially old Irish. But the Latin, instead of \nstressing certain syllables, it is more about “longs and shorts”. And \nyet the scribes – the people who were trained in writing the poetry – \nthey weren’t just Gaelic scholars, they were Latin scholars too. They \ncould also compose in English, and quite possibly in Greek and Hebrew. \n I have to think that there is some rubbing of elbows in the \nmeeting of these cultures and how to handle the associated music."] "\n" [:p {} "A lot of comparison has been done between early Irish harp traditions\n and parallel traditions in Scotland and Wales.

Then the Irish word for this \n(harmonic curve on the harp) is " [:em {} "cór"] ", which is really the same \nword for crane, the bird. Then when the crane becomes extinct in \nIreland, the name cór is given other long necked water birds like heron \nand egret."] "\n" [:p {} "But back to Benone Strand – I never finished my story! That’s the \nstrand near where Denis O’Hampsey, the last of the early Irish harpers, \nwas born and lived. I consider him the last because he was the last \nplaying in the old style with long nails. You know it sort of peters and\n dribbles on, but I have Denis O’Hampsey as the last. People played \nIrish harps but they they were later ones and they played with their \nfinger pads and not nails, and it changed lots. So for me the end of the\n old tradition is with 97 year old Denis O’Hampsey. He was 97 in in 1792\n when they collected his music. He died at 114 years of age. He was born\n near the end of the 1600s and lived into the 1800s. He lived in three \ncenturies."] "\n" [:p {} "Anyway Benone Strand is next to where Denis O’Hampsey  lived, \nand his patron was in also this area. So you’ve got the whale as the \nsymbol animal of the harp, the skull structure of the whale looks like \nthe harp lying on its back. Well, the right whale was nearly fished out \nwhen Denis O’Hampsey died. So the symbol animal of the instrument went \ndown just like the instrument. And now the right whale has a slight come\n back, but it’s still really endangered. So you know, I see a \nrelationship with this instrument and the right whale. Isn’t there a \nbeauty to that?"] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "That is beautiful. I think it’s a nice place to wrap up our \nconversation. Thanks so much!
