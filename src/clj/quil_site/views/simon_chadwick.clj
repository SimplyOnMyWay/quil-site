        [:strong {} " Simon, to start I’d love to focus on your playing of the \nJointure &amp; Jigg.  Can you talk us through your arrangement of \nthis piece? " [:span {:style "font-size: xx-small;"} "[2012]"]] "\n"
        [:p {} "Simon Chadwick:" [:br {}] "\nWell I properly became familiar with this tune in 2010 I think. Neal was the theme of the summer school, " [:em {} "Scoil na gCláirseach"] ". Nicholas Carolan had just put out his new edition of the facsimile " [:em {} "A Colection of the Most Celebrated Irish Tunes"] "\n by John and William Neal, and because of that we themed the summer \nschool around Neal. So everyone was teaching Neal tunes, and talking \nabout Neal tunes. Ann Heymann played the Neal version of the Jointure \n(titled " [:em {} "Stáraí ‘ghoid mo chlú-sa uaim"] " in Neal),  and I\n thought “wow this is a nice tune.” I was chatting to her about the \ntitles and I got more and more interested in it."] "\n"
        [:p {} "When I got home after " [:em {} "Scoil"] " I thought perhaps I should play \nthis tune, and so I got out Neal and worked up a version. I think it has\n since gone a bit away from Neal because the more I played it the more I\n developed ideas about it."] "\n"
        [:p {} [:strong {} "It is an interesting piece in many ways, particularly in that\n there are two versions of the same tune – one in Neal and another in \nBunting.  " [:span {:style "font-size: xx-small;"} "[2012]"]]]
        [:br {}] "\nWell that is fascinating. There are other tunes that appear separately \nin Neal and Bunting as well. They can be quite different and you may \nargue about the relationship between them."
        [:br {}] "\n"
        [:strong {} [:br {}] "\nIs there quite a close match between the Neal and Bunting versions of the Jointure? " [:span {:style "font-size: xx-small;"} "[2012]"]]
        [:br {}] "\n

I don’t know! How do you judge how close or distant two versions are – I have no idea!" "\n"

        [:p {} [:strong {} "Well perhaps if somebody listening can straight away tell it is the same tune? " [:span {:style "font-size: xx-small;"} "[2012]"]] [:br {}]

         "\nYes, it’s the same tune. Also they both have the “Jigg” following the \nJointure air. In fact the Jigg is closer in the two versions. It’s the \nair which is slightly more different in each source, which is \ninteresting. So you know there is the whole question of where Neal got \nhis tunes from, who has recast them etc. My suspicion is Neal was \nprinting harp tunes that they got through the fiddle tradition. So I \nthink this fiddle idiom in the Neal collection gets rid of some of the \nharp idiom. Whereas obviously Bunting is noting direct from the harpers,\n so his field notes direct us to stuff full of harp idiom."] "\n"

        [:p {} [:strong {} "So Neal would have been notating from fiddle players? " [:span {:style "font-size: xx-small;"} "[2012]"]] [:br {}] "\nNo, more likely he was commissioning fiddle players to provide them\n with scores to publish. Remember that Neal wasn’t an Irish music \ncollector like Bunting. He was a general, run of the mill, music \npublisher. He published all kinds of fashionable London stuff. He just \ndid a couple of little books of country dances, a book of Scottish \nmusic, a book of Irish music – these were small projects.  So he \nwould have had a fiddle contact – someone in the fiddle tradition, or in\n the violin tradition perhaps – who knew or collected this piece, then \nset it as notated music ready to be published."] "\n"
        [:p {} "When I started playing this tune I wasn’t in strict historical mode. \nInstead I thought it was a nice tune I would like to play. So I didn’t \ndo a huge amount of work trying to find the early sources, or trying to \ncompare the two versions. I just looked at Neal, played it through a few\n times, let it drift a bit until I was happy. So it was a bit more \ncreative, more free and easy."] "\n"
        [:p {} "With this creative mindset, I interpreted it as a lament. I was \nreally interested because it has got three titles. The Gaelic (Irish \nlanguage) title is " [:em {} "Stáraí ‘ghoid mo chlú-sa uaim"] " which\n I think is obviously a song air – to me it is obviously the first line \nof a song, although we don’t have the song unfortunately. So that’s the \nfirst clue – a big eighteenth-century song."] "\n"
        [:p {} "Generally speaking, I look for a vocal version whenever I can. When \nit’s a purely instrumental piece, I look for a mouth music version. If \nit’s a song air I look for the song. So there are no song words \navailable for " [:em {} "Stáraí ‘ghoid mo chlú-sa uaim"] " that I know of, but you can still kind of pretend."] "\n"
        [:p {} "The second title is " [:em {} "the Golden Star"] ".  I had an \ninsight, perhaps because I’m a “foreigner” with an outrageous English \naccent who doesn’t speak any other language. I thought “well that’s what\n an English speaker would make of " [:em {} "Stáraí ‘ghoid…"] "” – you know – “Golden Star, that’ll do…”."] "\n"
        [:p {} [:strong {} "Whereas " [:em {} "stáraí"] " means rogue, with the title translating roughly as “rogue who stole my reputation from me”. " [:span {:style "font-size: xx-small;"} "[2012]"]] [:br {}] "\nExactly, so if you know nothing about that, you would kind of crunch it down into vaguely English words, and end up with" [:em {} " the Golden Star"] ", which\n is the name of a tune Bunting associates with the tune. So that \nwas my little idea, no idea if it is correct or not, but I thought that \nwas fun!"] "\n"
        [:p {} "The third title is the Jointure, which means a widow’s legal \nallowance, something like that. So I started to think of a song story \nabout a rogue who steals away your health or livelihood or whatever. Is \nthis a lament by a woman, because her husband has died?"] "\n"
        [:p {} "So through this way of thinking, I was instantly into lament mode. As\n it happened I had been working on laments for a few years, for a CD \nrecording project called Old Gaelic Laments."

        [:p {} "It’s not really like a chord progression, it’s just tracking the \nmelody down with a shifting drone. And then you’ve got this idea that if\n you’re doing in an E sonority you’ve got the higher E, the lower E, the\n fifth in the middle. You can use combinations of them to give a \nslightly different texture to the melody note, to point the melody note \nin a different way. To make it harder or softer …[music]."] "\n"
        [:p {} "So there I’m thickening up a bit. At this point I’ve got a bit of \nC-chord going on the base, which is the fourth of the scale. I guess \nthis gives it a bit of a continental functional harmony kinda flavour. \nBut it’s just a hint of it, and I’m kind of interested in that – because\n I think the tune kinda invites you to, though you don’t have to. And \nthere are different places in the old music where you get a sniff of \nthat possibility, of a more classical sound. But I think that G to E\n movement is very characteristic of old Irish music."] "\n"
        [:p {} "[Music]… there’s a whole chunk of the tune missing just at this \npoint, because of the way it was in my head, it wasn’t there and every \ntime I played the tune I’d skip a few bars. And they’re nice bars as \nwell!"] "\n"
        [:p {} "And the jig, to get it more rhythmical, I’m hitting bass notes more \nrhythmically on the pulse. That beginning section is like coupled-hands \nstyle, with the hands alternating.

I got the tune " [:em {} "The Lament for the Union"] " up and running, which is a " [:em {} "pibroch "] "\n tune, and is supposedly composed as a commentary on the Act of Union, \nabout 300 years ago – don’t ask me the date! And then I thought I should\n make a recording of it, and I should make a CD and I can sell it to \npolitically aware people. " [:em {} "The Lament for the Union"] " was 15 \nminutes long and I thought “well, what else can I put on it?”. I found \nan anecdote about a tune that was played at the Palace in Edinburgh – so\n I added that."] "\n"
        [:p {} "And then I also came across an anecdote about " [:em {} "a Stáraí ‘Ghoid mo Chlú-sa Uaim"] ",\n that connects it to the Act of Union. This is an important part of the \nlore surrounding this tune. And so I included it. I didn’t re-record it –\n I used the recording from the Laments CD on my Union CD. I put the \nstory in the liner notes. It’s a cool story, from the memoirs of Arthur \nO’Neill  in " [:em {} "Annals of the Irish Harpers"] ".

         "\nThe Duke of Argyll was like the architect of the Act of Union, so you \nknow he was the political mover and shaker in Queen Anne’s \nreign. Arthur O’Neill says the Duke of Argyll “heard of the \ncelebrity of Heffernan who was a London tavern keeper that \nplayed the Irish harp. And the Duke of Argyll came to his tavern \nwith a large group of people to  hear him play. The Duke called for\n a Scottish tune. But Heffernan, being of a good Irish turn of \nmind, played him the Golden Star, which is a very plaintive Irish tune. \nHis lordship said it was too melancholy for a Scotch tune. ‘Oh my lord’ \nsays Heffernan, ‘you must know it was composed since the Union!&#39;”."] "\n"

Then I thought of how \nHeffernan says  it was composed since the Union. 1707 wasn’t it, \nthe Act of Union? So if it is composed after 1707, well that’s about the\n time that Connellan was in Edinburgh and he was made of burgess at\n the city. So if he was in Edinburgh at that time, maybe he composed it \nas a political satire or commentary or something. I don’t know, it’s \njust possible that it was composed as a political thing, so I thought \nthat was interesting."] "\n"
