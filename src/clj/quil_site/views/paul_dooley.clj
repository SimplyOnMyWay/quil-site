        [:p {} "Paul Dooley:" [:br {}] "\nWell traditional Irish dance music on the harp is my thing really. \nThat’s the reason I started playing the harp in the first place. I heard\n Alan Stivell play jigs in the 70s and that’s what I’ve wanted to do \never since. I wasn’t really interested in the old harpers and all that \nkind of stuff… 17th century and 18th century, medieval and what have \nyou. As I went on I discovered more about it and then I became \ninterested. But in my younger days jigs and reels was all I was after \nreally! So it was interesting to discover that jigs were played on the \nharp for as long as they’ve existed – jigs that is not harps. Now they \nprobably didn’t play them exactly in the same way we are playing them \ntoday, more stately maybe, but this one seems to fit the bill pretty \nwell. It was taken from O’Hampsey by Bunting [based on where it sits in \nMS4.29] so it was played with nails on a harp with metal strings."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} " We were talking about this piece appearing in the 1724 Neal collection as well. "] [:br {}] "\nWell it’s interesting because there’s at least three versions of the \nJointure and Jigg going. There is the one published by Bunting in 1796 \n[in E] and the one in the manuscript that he got from O’Hampsey – ever \nso slightly different from the published version [in G], and there is \nthe one in the Neal collection [in F]. The slow tune in the Neal version\n is also different, not quite the same as what Bunting has. So \nyou’d wonder is that down to actual mistakes or were the harpers and \nmusicians at the time of Neal and O’Hampsey a bit loose about how they \nplayed the tunes, or both. It was composed by Thomas Connellan (d. 1698)\n sometime in the late 1600s and it was still on the go a hundred years \nlater, when O’Hampsey played it for Bunting, so it might well have \nchanged along the way a bit. Anyway, the version I learned is the one \nfrom Bunting’s manuscript 29."] "\n"
        [:p {} [:strong {} "If you could play it through that’d be great! And as you’re \ntuning Paul could you talk us through the approach you have to tuning \nthe harp for this piece?"] [:br {}] "\nI use a few different approaches. One of them is to use an electronic \ntuner and sometimes that works well but more times it doesn’t. It’s \nimportant to understand that things are never fully in tune anyway for a\n start! On the metal-strung harp everything rings on and the harmonics \nare very strong, so if you don’t use the tuner you’ll tend to gravitate \ntowards ‘just’ intonation, or if you tuned only in fifths it would be \nPythagorean tuning."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Are there two comhluí G’s on this harp?"] [:br {}] "\nNo, when started playing I wasn’t aware of the ‘sister strings’ tuning, \nor the left shoulder thing either. When I did find out about it, it was \ntoo late to change. Neither of those things make any real difference to \nwhat you can and can’t play on a harp and after playing for years with \none set up the readjustment would be huge, for me anyway."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "What is your first note to start tuning?"] [:br {}] "\nThat all depends. I’d suspect that compared to what my equal-tempered \nelectronic tuner says, the A here is going to be slightly sharp to the \nD, and the F [sharp] is a good bit flat. But that’s how it sounds good, \nso away you go from there! If I was using the electronic tuner the \ntuning wouldn’t be quite like this. But the harp can go out of tune \nquite a bit anyway, especially if it gets very cold or hot very quickly.\n The harp doesn’t like sudden changes in temperature or humidity. It \nwill stay perfectly stable if the temperature or humidity doesn’t \nchange. It tends to tighten up with increased humidity and go sharp, and\n flatten with heat. So if you get a hot humid day or a cold dry day it \ndoesn’t know where it’s going!"] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Is tuning by fifths is your approach generally?"] [:br {}] "\nWell I tune certain fifths to be pure, or stable I should say. For \nexample, this tune will have the fifth from D to A in it, so that I’ll \ntune that pretty good. And since there is a lot of D in this piece, the \nF-sharps are going to be a bit flat, to give a sweet major third from \nthe D. And then the B’s are going have to be flat to make the B-F-sharp \nfifths, because the F-sharps are flat, and so on. But depending on what \ntune you’re going to play that doesn’t necessarily work, but for the \nJointure [in D] it does, it kinda does anyway!"] "\n"

At the time I started playing\n the harp I read an article in Ceol magazine by Gráinne Yeats where she \ntalked about a fragment of a book, from 1742 I think – it’s in the \nNational Library. It had compositions of O’Carolan with a bass line and \nhis son was involved in the publication. She said that the bass line \nmoved in single notes that it didn’t seem to make much sense according \nto conventional harmony. So I thought that’s a great idea – just move in\n single notes.

There’s \nmore of a kind of boom sound from the lower strings so it can make for a\n very active… oumphy… bass line. This could be quite good if \nyou’re playing in a big session, playing with melody instruments that \nare also carrying the tune. The heavy bass may be too strong for your \nown melody line, but if you are playing with other melody instruments as\n well, then that is counterbalanced. In that case the bass doesn’t \nobscure the tune anymore – other people are loud enough – so that \noverall the balance between the melody and bass is at the right level."] "\n" [:h2 {} [:strong {} "ARRIVING AT THE HARP"]] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Paul I’d love if you could you talk about your own musical journey, how you arrived at the harp."] [:br {}] "\nOr how did the harp arrive at me! Well, growing up in Canada I used to \nplay the guitar, I used to like rock and roll and all kinds of things. \nOne time my father brought home a record of Alan Stivell playing the \nharp. It was his Renaissance of the Celtic harp and I was just blown \naway by the sound of it, and especially the sound of jigs played on the \nharp. I’ve just been fascinated by the harp ever since."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "How long did it take from the time you first heard that Alan Stivell record to when you began playing yourself?"] [:br {}] "\nOh I was about 10 when that came out, my father actually made a harp \naround that time. He got a kit from a mail order place, in California I \nthink, and he made the harp and we played with it for a bit. Then there \nwas a loud bang in the middle of the night and the thing collapsed \nbecause it was under too much tension. It wasn’t a great design anyway."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Was this a metal-strung harp?"] [:br {}] "\nNo. Maybe it should have been metal-strung right enough. It had a type \nof nylon strings, like the bass strings on a classical guitar. It \nsounded quite nice for the time it lasted. Anyway so that was that. My \nbrother played classical music on the guitar and he ended up learning \nthe concert harp for a while. I didn’t do any music then for a few \nyears. I left home as you do, and eventually found my way to Dublin. I \nalways had in my mind that I’d like to make a harp, as I liked that \nsound. I would go to Trinity – it was free that time – you’d go into the\n Long Room where the book of Kells and the harp was. I’d be looking at \nit, the shape of it, fascinated. I realised that once your tuning pegs \nworked, your harp could be in tune and that whatever other flaws it \nmight have, it would be playable. It wouldn’t be like a flute with a \nhole in the wrong place or a guitar with a fret in the wrong place – \nwhich could never work ever. You could make a harp that would work very \neasily, and quickly. So I made my first harp and got into it a bit more.\n I had the view to maybe try to make a living at making instruments but I\n found out very soon that it wasn’t going to be possible."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Was this at a time when you were in Trinity as a student?"] [:br {}] "\nNo no, I used to just go in as a tourist, at that time I was working in a restaurant in Dublin."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "And so had you made furniture or other instruments?"] [:br {}] "\nNot really no. You know, there were tools at home, and I’d make goal posts or a basketball stand or the like from time to time."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "So you’re naturally very good with your hands. Not everyone \nwould feel that they could just pick up a set of tools and make a \nharp!"] [:br {}] "\nWell I had made a window and a couple of other things – I had basic \nskills, but nothing fancy. My first harp was a very crude affair. The \nsoundbox was made of plywood and the frame was made out of four by two’s\n that were cut roughly in the shape of a harp. But it very quickly came \nunder too much pressure and didn’t last very long. But it sounded \ngreat. I lived in a Georgian building that had lovely window surrounds –\n with shutters and a low platform. So I had the harp up on that and once\n it was sitting on that, there was a lovely bass sound­ – almost as if \nthe whole window surround acted as a soundbox. To compensate for my poor\n plywood! Once you lifted it off the thing sounded really dull! But I \nmanaged to get Brian Ború’s March and a couple of other things out of \nit."] "\n" [:h2 {} [:strong {} "HARP-MAKING"]] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Was the harp design based on the Trinity harp?"] [:br {}] "\nYeah, roughly. As much as you could by looking at the back of a ten \npence or a fifty pence coin at the time – that was the biggest one there\n was!"] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "And even if you were able to get your hands on the original \nharp sitting in Trinity, that has got parts missing down around the \nbottom of the fore-pillar. "] [:br {}] "\nYes that area is missing. The Trinity harp doesn’t sit quite right, but \nit’s not very wrong either as it turns out. I’ve done quite a bit of \nresearch on that a few years ago now."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "The dimensions of the fore-pillar impacts the length of the strings and maybe even the number of strings doesn’t it?"] [:br {}] "\nWell this is it. The first harp I made looked like the one on the back \nof the money just about. It sounded… just about okay! It had guitar \nstrings all the way to top because I didn’t know where you’d get harp \nstrings. I really didn’t know anything about harps at all – I mean the \nnearest I would have really been to a working harp would have been \nlooking in the window in Waltons. These harps were very expensive. I \ndidn’t really twig that their strings were coloured, or were gut. It \ndidn’t occur to me because Alan Stivell’s harp definitely sounded like \nit had metal strings so I just assumed all small Irish harps had metal \nstrings. I hadn’t really given the concert harp any thought at all."] "\n" [:p {} "So anyway, as I went on I discovered that it’s just not good enough \nto make a pretty curve here on the neck and a pretty curve there on the \nfore-pillar. That’s not how it works, there’s a lot more to it than \nthat. I realised that the lengths of the strings have to relate to each \nother in a certain way because otherwise they might start breaking, or \nsome of them would be too loose."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Has this ratio of string lengths got to do with distributing the loading on the soundbox?"] [:br {}] "\nNot so much that. The ‘loading’ [the total amount of tension] comes from\n a different thing. It’s from the string gauges you use. If you replace a\n string with a thicker one, you’ll have to put a lot more tension on \nthat thicker string to reach the same note. Because the strength of the \nstring is proportional to the area of its cross-section – the bigger \nthat is, the stronger the string – it would still break at the same note\n more or less, so it can reach the same pitch but it’s just not going to\n sound the same. It might even sound like it wants to go higher – even \nif that’s not possible – before it starts sounding right."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Is this because it just has to vibrate at a given frequency?"] [:br {}] "\nNot quite, it’s because it won’t sound true – or not great – unless it’s\n tuned high enough. If it’s too low [loose] it makes harmonics that \naren’t really in tune with other notes you might want to play. So the \nmore taut the string is the more those harmonics are in tune. They’ll be\n still sharp but not quite as much. As you loosen the strings or as the \nmetal is stiffer and harder – there’s a lots of variables – they’ll be \nsharper and sharper, so basically the string should be as taut as \npossible to get the best sound possible."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "So quite a narrow string could be the best could be the optimum?"] [:br {}] "\nYes! It is counterintuitive. For instance, if your bass string isn’t \nworking great, a thinner string [of the same material] will probably do a\n better job than a thicker one, whereas you would assume that it is the \nother way around. That’s because the thinner string is going to be more \nflexible."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "I would have thought that the thicker the strings, the longer your harp is going last but that’s not necessarily true is it?"] [:br {}] "\nIt could be the opposite even if tension is the issue. The thicker \nstring will just pull more, it will demand more tension to give you the \nsame note."] "\n" [:p {} "Back to the design of the harp. It takes a bit of figuring out but \nbasically by experiment you know that a string of a certain length will \nmake you that note nicely, and if it is shorter than that it is not \ngoing to be as nice, whereas if it’s too long it’s going to break. From \nthat, theoretically you can also work out what length each string on the\n harp needs to be with mathematical ratios. How they did it in the old \ndays, I don’t know, but they did it! They worked out the lengths of \nstrings to make a harp that was balanced properly, so that the strings \nwouldn’t break. It is not good enough to just copy a harp because it \nlooks a certain way. You have to understand what drove the design in the\n first place. So to copy the one in Trinity exactly may not be the best \nthing to do because it is sitting with a load of resin here and there. \nFiguring out the original design needs a bit of work but as I said \nearlier, it so happens that it’s near enough."] "\n" [:p {} "My good friend Paddy Cafferky who makes fantastic gut-strung harps, \nanswers that question most succinctly: how would you determine the shape\n of the harp? “Basically you get the strings and you build a harp around\n it.” That’s the easiest way to answer it."] "\n" [:p {} "In other words you decide what notes you want, you decide what \nlengths they need to be to sound nice, and you fit the harp around that.\n So if you get brass strings, you know if the string is the length of \nthis table it’ll be such a note. It needs to be longer to be a note \nlower or shorter for a note higher. And just go from there, and \ndepending on the kind of tensions your going for you’ll end up with \nsomething that looks like a Trinity or a Queen Mary harp or similar."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "In your own journey as a harp maker, was there anybody else \nmaking early Irish harps at that time you were starting out, or was it \njust out of necessity for your own playing that you began making harps?"] [:br {}] "\nWell for me it was out of necessity because I couldn’t possibly afford \none of Walton’s harps, and they weren’t metal-strung anyway. There were \nother people making them I’m sure. Peter Kilroy in Kenmare would have \nbeen making harps, at the same time or even before that. Paul Doyle in \nStrokestown was making harps, also Michael Billinge in Cork. I don’t \nthink anyone else in Ireland was making them then, I’m talking about \nmetal-strung harps now and we’re talking pre-internet times here so \nthere was no instant way of accessing anything like now.

With the higher notes red brass doesn’t \ncarry that well, but it has a very nice low to mid-range.

From there on you just pull \nit through smaller and smaller holes. Every time you hit the metal or as\n you work it, it gets harder so you have to anneal it regularly to stop \nsmall cracks and defects from forming during that process. But you also \nneed to anneal it because with every pass it becomes physically harder \nto get it through the next hole in the drawplate [or the next die] and \nthen it’s also harder on the tools. I’d imagine the tools would have \nbeen precious back then. So anyway when the wire gets to maybe \n1.5–1.2mm, you would anneal it for the last time. At that point the wire\n can be drawn small enough without causing defects."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Thinking about the basics of drawing metal strings, why is \nthe lower range likely to be that bit softer without the same number of \nannealing processes as the higher range?"] [:br {}] "\nIn that sequence I described it would have the same amount of annealing,\n but the treble has more cold working, which hardens the metal. As it \ngets thinner and thinner you don’t have to anneal it anymore because the\n percentage of squeezing that goes on – or reduction – is still the same\n relatively speaking but there is much less metal getting squashed. Of \ncourse it’s possible to have the lower range drawn really hard as well. \nIt would just mean the last annealing needs to take place earlier.

But if I was doing it \nagain – if I knew then what I know now – I would follow the fingering \nthe way he has deciphered it because it makes perfect sense to me."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Does it specify what shoulder the harp is played on?"] [:br {}] "\nNot really, but the pictures of Welsh harps show the harp on the left \nshoulder, and some of the figuration and symbols in the Ap Huw \nmanuscript hint that you’re looking at strings and fingers on the left \nside. But which shoulder it is played on doesn’t really make much \ndifference because your hands are symmetrical anyway, so it’s not like \nyou need to fundamentally change anything either way. Originally, or \nbefore you see depictions of harps, you see lyres on high crosses and in\n medieval illuminations. The lyre was held against the left shoulder \nwith the right hand strumming, and with the left hand fingers blocking \nstrings and shaping chords. This left hand function probably became more\n complicated later [plucking as well as blocking], while the right hand \nwas acting only as a plectrum. So that right hand becomes the bow on a \nfiddle or the strumming hand on a guitar, while the left hand did the \nmore dexterous fingering. This is probably how the harp ended up being \nplayed on the left shoulder. When keyboard instruments came in the \ntreble was on the right hand side, so it eventually migrated to the \nright hand on the harp also. That’s my theory on it anyway!"] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Can you play a favourite piece of yours from the Ap Huw manuscript? "] [:br {}] "\nThis is a piece called Gosteg Dafydd Athro.

There was a \ntransliteration of this in the Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales [1807] and \nBunting was in contact with the editors about it.

According to Gerald of Wales’ account, they all imitated \nIreland to rival each other in musical style. But how long did this \nlast? Other influences came from the continent and everywhere else.

He said to Bunting that it pained\n him too much to play the old tunes, that he wouldn’t bother! It’s a \nvery frustrating thing. He played that little prelude Féach an gléas. He\n was giving out that the harpers of the day didn’t really understand the\n old music. So this older music he is talking about, we only have a \nsnippet of it in what Bunting got from him. Under the hood the prelude \ndoesn’t work like the Ap Huw music, but on the face of it the chords are\n similar to some of the pieces [profiadau in particular]. The way it is \nornamented, you couldn’t justify changing the timing from the way \nBunting has written it because he is consistent there. It is funny \nbecause Bunting says in the 1840 [p. 27] that all the chords were \narpeggiated downwards. But he arpeggiated the prelude upwards twice in \nthe original notebook [MS 29], but it’s downwards in one of his later \narrangements [MS 12], and he blamed his engraver in a footnote [1840, p.\n 87] for putting it upwards in the publication."] "\n" [:p {} "I think the one thing we can conclude is that you can’t be too \ndogmatic about any interpretation of what Bunting says. I mean the idea \nthat the Irish wouldn’t have used the triads or thirds when they did use\n them in Wales way before that. Did they all of a sudden decide to stop \nusing them in Ireland? It’s hard to imagine. If the Welsh were copying \nthe Irish and they [the Welsh] were using all these [triads and thirds],\n did the Irish decide to stop, thinking “ah no the Welsh are copying us \nwe’re going to stop doing that!” I don’t think so! So they probably did \narpeggiate upwards and downwards when it suited them. In O’Hampsey’s day\n it wouldn’t have been as regulated as it would have been further back. I\n suppose it’s not so much that it would have been heavily regulated, but\n there wasn’t really anywhere to go in the medival system. I mean once \nyou had learned a tune in a certain way [properly] there wasn’t room for\n adding or taking out stuff.
