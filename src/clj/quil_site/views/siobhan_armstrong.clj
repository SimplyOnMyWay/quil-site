This piece occurs in the Bunting manuscripts – Bunting writes \nthat he copied it down from the playing of Hugh Higgins in the early \n1790s but both the piece and the accompanying jig occur in his notebook \namong material he notates from Dennis O’Hampsey so it can’t be said, \ndefinitively, to be from Higgins. There’s also a version that shows up \nmuch earlier in 1724 in the first collection of Irish tunes ever to be \npublished in Ireland – A Collection of the Most Celebrated Irish Tunes \nby John and William Neal. So there’s a version in there as well and the \nNeal version has one of the Irish titles, " [:em {} "A Stáraí ‘Ghoid mo Chlú-sa Uaim"] ",\n which roughly translates as ‘rude person who stole my reputation from \nme’. So it’s obviously from a woman’s point of view and it’s the old \nstory that we all know. In Neal it is in some ways a Europeanised \nversion – afterwards, it says, there is a ‘jigga’, a more italianate \nterm, but the same old rhythm that we’ve all known since the Middle \nAges: a compound duple rhythm."] "\n" [:p {} "So it was published in Neal in 1724, and then Bunting got it – called\n ‘The Jointure or Golden Star by Connellan’ – but Bunting then gives the\n Irish title down at the bottom as " [:em {} "Era ‘Ghadaí Ghoid mo Shláinte Uaim"] "\n so here it translates as ‘the thief who stole my health from me’, so a \nslightly different title. Much further in the notebook that Bunting \nstarts in Belfast in 1792, he gives the jig. The two are separated in \nthe notebook – they don’t occur together."] "\n" [:p {} "The first thing you notice about the piece is that it’s the usual \nthing we expect with an Irish tune, as in ‘it’s the tune’. But of course\n there’s more going on in the Bunting manuscripts in that sometimes you \nget bass indications. So in the second half of this tune you get a \nlittle hint. In the first half it’s only the tune, so we have no idea \nwhat the bass will play, and that’s the thing that’s of enormous \ninterest to me and is my research work these years. Well I suppose it \nhas been my research for a long time but now it’s my official research \nwork as part of the PhD I am doing, or the main thrust of the PhD – what\n did the bass hand do? So if we look at the second half of the tune we \nsee the little capital B for ‘bass’ that Bunting sometimes uses to \nindicate what the bass hand is playing. And we also have an idea because\n the stems go up and down in the manuscript. So in the second half of \nthe tune, I knew that straight away I would be doing …[music]… so you \nhave what sounds like …[music]… so, jumping around all over the place."

If he indicates here \n…[music]… why am I not playing down there …[music]? So let’s have a \nlisten, maybe I should have done …[music]. That could be. But I think \nfrom looking at these pages now for a long time, I think it’s expedient \nfor Bunting, if he can easily notate something at pitch, he does. It’s \neasy to write that [B] and the [D] there underneath the stave …[music]. \nBut the [E, G] that’s very tricky – now you’re into lots of ledger lines\n for that bottom E. So I think that’s why he writes it up there \n…[music]… because it’s just too difficult to write it down here \n…[music]… but he means it down there. So he means this …[music]… this is\n already an octave lower.

So that’s the question for \nus!"] "\n" [:h1 {} "BASS-HAND EVIDENCE IN THE BUNTING DRAFT MANUSCRIPTS"] "\n" [:p {} "You need to be looking at every source of information you can \npossibly get your hands on. In the Bunting manuscripts themselves there \nis a lot of information about bass hand, and many little bass hand \nindications. When I was playing the modern Irish harp as a child, the \ngeneral story on the block was “oh you know, the music is in the mists \nof time, we have no idea really how all that worked, there’s nothing \nleft and we couldn’t possibly ever hope to go there.” And you think, \n“well yes and no”. It’s a broken tradition – so it ends shortly after \n1800, depending on how you define the end of the tradition – it’s \nsomewhere in the early nineteenth century. So it’s a broken tradition \nand we cannot know, but there’s lots of information that we can have a \nlook at. So I’ve been looking, over the last few years, looking in a \nvery concentrated way at Bunting’s draft versions of the tunes. Because \nof course they’re the ones that are of primary interest – there’s no \npoint really in looking at his published work, that’s Victorian piano \nmusic. There is some point I suppose in looking at his manuscript piano \narrangements. Because the earlier ones – he starts getting more and \nmore, how would you say, ‘flouncy’ as he goes, his arrangements become \nmore and more action-packed as he goes through his life – but the \nearlier ones, I think there is something to be gleaned from harper \nperformance practice in those."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Is that because these piano arrangements were earlier and so closer to the actual time he sat with the harpers?"] [:br {}] "\nYeah, I think it is several things. I think you’re right on the money. I\n think it’s that maybe he remembers better. But I think it’s also that \nhis heart was in the right place – he really wanted to show what the \nharpers were doing, but he may have been pushed a bit by his publisher, \nor maybe by market forces, or a desire to conform with European music. \nThat he maybe wanted to show – later on – how sophisticated it could be.\n So we can guess at the reasons why his reconstructions or arrangements \ngot more complex. But in the early days I think it’s possibly much \ncloser to what the harpers were doing."] "\n" [:p {} "But this is still the closest you can get, given that there are no \nprimary sources for early Irish harp music. So obviously the harpers \ndon’t need to write anything down in that way that most musicians in the\n world, in all traditions, don’t need to write it down. Because why \nwould you? It’s all in your head. Our tradition is a medieval music \ntradition and of course in the Middle Ages lots of things didn’t get \nwritten down. It would be almost embarrassing to write it down. That \nwould mean there’s something defective with your memory, and the memory \nwas the thing. We know from from Bardic poetry how important it was that\n everything was memorised – it got written down only sometimes. And we \nknow in general European terms about the ‘memory palace’, that it was a \nmark of pride that you would have everything memorised. So it was almost\n a failing to have to write things down."] "\n" [:p {} "Of course the fact that most of our harpers were blind mitigates \nagainst them writing things down anyway. They were tying into maybe an \nearlier aesthetic and performing tradition."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Was the Jointure in the early manuscripts or not? I’m just \ntrying to ascertain how much information you can glean from manuscript \n33 or are you going right back to manuscript 29 exclusively?"] [:br {}] "\nThe Jointure is published in the 1796 volume. So that’s the thing. This \nis published within four years of Bunting hearing it. So that’s got to \nbe important. He gives just those two bass hand indications in the \nsecond half. So for all the rest of it, you better be looking around \nyourself within that draft notebook to see if there’s anything else you \ncan glean."] "\n" [:p {} "And so I’ve been gleaning for quite a while, and if it’s of interest \nto you I can share with you maybe the bass hand evidence that I’ve come \nup with so far from the draft notebooks."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Yes, absolutely!"] [:br {}] "\nSo it would seem to me that you can start to categorise the different \nkinds of bass hand evidence that you see in the manuscript. If you can \ndo that then maybe you can start to utilise it in pieces like this that \ndon’t have bass hand. So that’s basically what I was trying to do for \nyou there when I was playing the piece – to utilise the information that\n I’ve gleaned from other pieces that do have bass."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "So that allows you to interpret, for example, what an up-staff or down-staff indicates?"] [:br {}] "\nWell yeah, I mean the more you look at the manuscripts the more you’re \ngoing to become familiar with them and the more you’re going to be able \nto glean out of them, that’s for sure."] "\n" [:p {} "So the first shocking thing for a European musician – or I suppose \nfor anybody familiar with European music who looks at the manuscripts – \nis that because he’s writing down music in the eighteenth century you \nmight expect this music to have a bass-line, because of course music all\n around Europe in the seventeenth- and eighteenth centuries was built \nfrom the bottom up. The bass was the basis of everything, to the extent \nthat you had bass improvisation patterns. You’d have riffs that you \ncould improvise tunes over, or variations / divisions on melodies. And \nso it was very ‘bass-centered’."] "\n" [:p {} "But this music seems to be exactly the opposite. And maybe we \nshouldn’t be surprised because it’s coming from a medieval place, not \nfrom a seventeenth- and eighteenth century place. In the Middle Ages the\n tune was paramount – certainly in less sophisticated music – because of\n course you find polyphony, multi-voice music in the medieval period – \nbut for compositions like this, it tends to be melody-based and the bass\n isn’t so important at all. Even all the way into the fifteenth century,\n if you look at some of the earliest keyboard music, the bass isn’t \nquite there yet. So I think we’re still channeling that older aesthetic \neven in the later centuries."] "\n" [:p {} "This is a piece by the composer Thomas Connellan, who was born in the\n seventeenth century. Of course we don’t know exactly how it sounded \nthen because Bunting heard it in the eighteenth century. Bu the first \nthing you notice in his draft notebooks is that there’s not much \nindependent bass underpinning the melody. There isn’t much evidence for \nstandard European harmony either, though of course the fact that we’re \nnot seeing it isn’t necessarily evidence of absence. So it’s hard to \nknow what you can safely deduce, and what you can’t."] "\n" [:p {} "There is ample evidence in the manuscript of compositional style that\n doesn’t follow the European rulebook. So we see lots of parallel \noctaves and things like that, even some parallel fifths. That is seen as\n an error in European music – you’d call the grammar police for that! – \nbecause it’s not okay at all to have parallel octaves. But in a Medieval\n context in European music that wouldn’t be a problem at all, and in an \nIrish context it’s clearly what was happening. Bunting wouldn’t add that\n as a sort of a fictional add-on, because for him it’s an error. So if \nhe’s writing it down it’s because it’s what he’s hearing. It’s \ndefinitely not something that he’s making up."] "\n" [:p {} "The bass notes tend to be melody dependent rather than, as I say, \nfollowing seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European practice, which \nis ‘bottom-up’. This tends to be ‘top-down’ – as in the bass notes often\n echo the melody notes. For example, in " [:em {} "Lady of the Desert"] " \nwhich Bunting notates – I’ll play you the actual bass line that’s in the\n manuscript …[music]… so the [g] keeps echoing the [G, g] and then \nfollowed by [E, B], [d] followed by [D,G] …[music]."

And what you’re also seeing there is a good \nexample of where the bass notes happen in gaps in the tune …[sings]. So \nthere’s stuff happening in gaps, not necessarily under the notes.

So here’s an \nexample of this kind of thing, this is " [:em {} "Bantiarna Ibheach / Lady Iveagh"] ", of Connellon.

Meanwhile, my wire-strung Ardival ‘Rose’\n harp, was just in the corner, quietly humming a tune as it were, not \neven out of tune, while the other harps were all basically committing \nsuicide! So perhaps that’s the reason we have metal strings? Because our\n climate does not like gut.

They would all \nplace the top string and the bottom string, and then would space the \nstrings evenly between one and the other. So you’d have an equidistant \nspacing along the harp. And of course now when we look at the harps it’s\n really clear that the string spacing is much more anarchic. Guy \nFlockhart was the first person to build an instrument with irregular \nspacing. He built a copy of the " [:em {} "Lamont"] " harp that Javier Sáinz \nhad for a long time. I think when Javier got the harp he said he was \nshocked because Guy Flockhart had faithfully copied what he saw on the \noriginal and nobody had ever done that before.

String spacing has \nimplications for damping and other things and/or maybe we don’t yet know\n quite why it was so.

That’s the job."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "I’ve tried singing with fiddle before. It’s a real battle, at\n least until you sort of split your brain – like patting your head and \nrubbing your tummy at the same time! But at a fiddle retreat last year, \nsomething came together and my playing completely and utterly changed \nfor a while as I sang. I was only lilting or vocalising the notes I was \nplaying – it was like my conscious mind was on singing and the \nsubconscious was playing, or maybe it was vice versa. But having played \nfiddle all my life without managing to sing, it was a lovely experience \nto be able to sing and play. It just felt so different, as if I was \nplaying from my body rather than my head. "] [:br {}] "\nIt’s important on so many levels because it affects everything to do \nwith your phrasing articulation. It affects fingering, it affects the \nfact that if you sing the song you absolutely know where the phrases \nend. And then I would tend not to finger across phrases, I tend to sort \nof take a mental break. So even if I’m not singing the song I hope that \nit’s all gone into the playing, that there’s lots of the song in the \nplaying – that’s what I’m trying to do, that’s my thing, the serious \naim, always. I think those of us who sing can tell straight away, when \nsomebody plays a tune, if they could sing that song or not. You know. \nYou know because it’s like Technicolor versus shades of grey. It just \nis, there’s no way around it. And I don’t say that as if you shouldn’t \nplay the music if you can’t sing the song – all I’m saying is if you \nplay the music, really, really consider strongly learning the language, \nor learning enough of it, or at least getting somebody to speak those \nwords and sing the words, to record them for you so that you have some \nchance."] "\n" [:p {} "And then of course there’s the whole thing about if you sing the song\n you have to figure out where to pitch it so that you could sing it and \nplay it. That’s a whole other really interesting area to me, that we \nhave these two traditional tunings, either with F-natural or F-sharp. So\n there are generally two places you can put your song and generally one \nof them will work and one of them won’t work. One of them will be too \nhigh or too low, and one of them will be just right. It’s like \nGoldilocks – the porridge will be just right, somewhere."] "\n" [:p {} "So that’s quite interesting, that if you draw out the parameters of \nthe historical tuning and a ‘comfy’ human voice, where we can \ncomfortably sing – if you draw a sort of Venn diagram, there will be the\n bit in the middle of it where that song will sit. Now you do have the \nproblems that I mentioned with the Carolan songs that even when you do \nall that it’s still often partially sitting outside the ‘comfy’ \nparameters. So there’s a whole other question there."] "\n" [:p {} "But the other thing that I’ve been noticing in song – I’ve noticed it\n in a few songs so far – iis that when you have a vocal setting that \nBunting takes from somebody and an instrumental setting that he takes \nfrom somebody else, like for example " [:em {} "Síle Ní Chonalláin"] ". I \nthink it’s from Charles Byrne and Daniel Black he takes the vocal \nversion, and then he takes a different version from Arthur O’Neill which\n is more ‘notey’ and it’s clearly an instrumental version. I didn’t \nunderstand the first few times I looked at these songs. In fact I \nrecorded " [:em {} "Síle Ní Chonalláin"] " with Róisín on her " [:em {} "Má Bhíonn Tú Liom Bí Liom"] "\n album that she did a number years ago. I didn’t understand then. So we \nrecorded the song in one place and it had to be artificially put \ntogether – the harp had to be retuned between the vocal version and the \ninstrumental version. It was only a few years later I realised what the \ndeal was. Often in these songs the instrumental version is in a \ndifferent mode to the vocal version. And you think “what’s that, why \nwouldn’t they be in the same mode?” So you can’t play them in the same \nplace. So the ‘comfy’ place for " [:em {} "Síle Ní Chonalláin"] " is in \nA-Aeolian or A-minor …[music]… So I’m speeding through just so I don’t \nwaste your time. So that’s in A-Aeolian, but the instrumental version \nworks in that same tuning with an [F-natural] only if you play it in \nD-Dorian …[music]…" [:br {}] "\n" [:iframe {:src "https://player.vimeo.com/video/325062020", :allowfullscreen "allowfullscreen", :width "640", :height "360", :frameborder "0"}] [:br {}] "\n[Music]… there it is – a related tune sitting in D-Dorian. And our vocal\n version is …[music]… and I thought “oh, that’s how this works – you \nkeep your tuning the same and you play the instrumental and the vocal \nversions where they sit within that tuning”. The vocal version is in \nA-Aeolian and the instrumental version is in D-Dorian. I thought “yes, \nisn’t that wonderful when you sing a song, that you can appear to \nmodulate”. I think they’re really clever compositions, that the vocal \nversion is in one place – you can play the instrumental version there \nand then the vocal version in a different mode deliberately, so you can \ngo …[music]… So you have this whole ‘lift’ of something else, and then \nyou have the vocal thing, and so it gives you contrast. So I’m wondering\n if that wasn’t a deliberate compositional ploy, that if you have \ninstrumental settings of songs that are in a different mode, that that’s\n deliberate so that with one tuning you can you don’t get like 65 verses\n in A!
