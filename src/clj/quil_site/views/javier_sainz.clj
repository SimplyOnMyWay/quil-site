        [:p {} "Javier Sáinz:" [:br {}] "\nSure. Well here it is …[music]."] "\n"

And when you chose, why, which one did you \nfind more appealing?"] [:br {}] "\nWell I had a look at both versions. I found the John and William Neal \nversion more interesting and I just preferred the melody. I found it was\n somehow easier to imbue with meaning in my arrangement. This was \nespecially true with the Jointure air – the jig is more fluent, its \nmelody almost volunteers chord options. In the case of the Jointure air,\n I have to say it is not an easygoing melody. It took longer to make an \narrangement because the melody is quite open and it doesn’t indicate \nvery much which direction to go. There are many open doors."] "\n"
        [:p {} "The John and William Neal version was published as we know in 1724. \nAccording to information we have, the Jointure air at least, and \nprobably the jig also, were composed by Thomas Connellan. He was active \nfrom the second half of the 17th century, so the Neal version is \nrelatively close in era to Connellan’s own lifetime."] "\n"
        [:p {} "We need to consider that at the time of printing, good harpers were \nstill active, following the tradition. There were more harpers in 1724 \nthan at the end of the 18th century at the Belfast harp meeting with \nBunting and O’Hampsey. In this first part of the 18th century there were\n still harpers, like Carolan for example, Lyons, etc."] "\n"
        [:p {} "So it all means to me that the Neal version, is in fact closer to the\n original. In any case I played both versions, and my inclination was \ndirected to John &amp; William Neal. As it happens, the Neal collection \nis one of my favorite sources. So I decided to work on that, on the Neal\n version."] "\n" [:p {} "And this being said you need to be clear when making an arrangement \nof these two tunes that they go together, one after the other. One being\n an air, a slow air, with a lot of feeling" [:br {}] "\nand expression. And then the jig is more lively. It is fundamental for \nany arrangement to clearly separate the spirit of the two tunes. What I \nmean is not to play the air too fast, the jig in a normal speed because \notherwise, there is no contrast. So what we need here is, whatever the \narrangement, to create a contrast. So the slow air should be played \nslow, and then the jig in a normal speed, let’s say it will be a good \ncontrast. Sometimes the tendency could be to play the air a little \nfaster, but then this contrast doesn’t work."] "\n" [:p {} "So the air required much more time to find an arrangement. Especially\n the beginning of the tune where in the Neal version it is in 4/4 time. \nAt the beginning there are several bars in which half of the bar is \nwithout notes. So you need to fill that somehow, to fill the" [:br {}] "\nbar with the arrangement. Otherwise the melody doesn’t flow."] "\n"
        [:p {} "In making an arrangement, once you know which chords you are going to\n use, you need to develop your imagination and try to find different \ncombinations and possibilities. You become closer to whatever idea you \nhave in your mind. And that’s the way it works. Some other melodies are \nso meaningful in themselves that the arrangement goes quicker but in \nthis case it is a difficult melody. You are not sure what the meaning of\n the melody itself is."] "\n" [:p {} "First you need to find different chords for the first three beats, \nlanding on the G-major which as an arriving point. So this G-major which\n is sat in the middle of the bar, you need to develop that. The first \ntime I played the A part, let’s say… once you find the chords, which in \nmy opinion are B, E-minor, and then G-major. So like this, adding some \nornaments …[music]."

I have used this technique\n …[shows]… in the last year, to give more – because this is a slow air –\n to give more expression and deepness to the bass. I sometimes use the \nthe second finger, not playing with the nail but in a vertical position \nplaying with the flesh, that gives a more rounded, [deeper] sound. In \nthis case it works, in my opinion, very well …[music]."] "\n" [:p {} "The second and third bar, again, we have this empty space that you \nneed to fill again with the same chord, G-major. An important point here\n is if you look to the melody at the end of the first part, which you \nthen need to repeat again, it’s a single note covering the whole bar, \nfour beats. So obviously there, if you [play only that single note in \nthe melody, with no bass] there’s a lot of empty time. So you need to \nfill that, and in this case I decided to create a dissonant movement \nplaying a chord of G-major, but then I introduced the C, the four-chord,\n to create a little tension, maintaining the interest, and then \nresolving finally in G."] "\n" [:p {} "The first ending …[music]… and ending the melody, well the bass if you like, in B, in a third."

But this beginning of the B-part, I found it more \ninteresting to give place to a new theme – so starting with C – and then\n we will inevitably arrive at E.

        [:p {} [:strong {} "Yeah, and so you consider that to be an important transition?"] [:br {}] "\nTo me it gives interest. It clearly sustains the melody. And from an harmonic point of view it makes sense."] "\n" [:p {} "E-minor is another option – I will not deny that. So that’s the \ncompromise. In doing an arrangement you need sometimes to choose. \nUnderstanding what I was going to do next I thought C-major works \nbetter, in my arrangement. In another arrangement E-minor could be \nbeautiful. This is the open thing, especially for air melodies like \nthis. It’s complex. And in the melody there is a little ambiguity. So \nyou need to take decisions."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "What mode do you consider the piece to be in?"] [:br {}] "\nWell this is another ambiguous question to reply to. Because let’s say \nthat all the endings in the first part and in second power go to G-major\n ending. This is a very … not modal way, but [reflecting] modern \nharmony, Baroque. So at least half of the A-part and half of the B-part –\n the endings – are in G-major. It is like Miss Hamilton by Cornelius \nLyons, which is a G-major tune clearly, but it is melancholy. That \ncombination of major chords G, and being not “happy”, I find those tunes\n very interesting."] "\n"
        [:p {} "The transition from modal music to tonal music cannot be given an \nexact date. There are many mixtures and experiments along the way. But \nif I need to choose I’d say this is a G-major air, with modal things."] "\n" [:p {} "In this sense C-major makes sense [at the start of the B-part] \nbecause as you know in a major tune, the most important chords are the \ntonic, let’s say G, and then C- and D-chords. So the chord of C, if this\n is a G-major tune, it is important to define the tonality."] "\n" [:p {} "But as I am saying to you there is not an exact moment that composer left the modal system and went to the tonal."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} [:br {}] "\nCan we talk about your arrangement of the Jigg?"] [:br {}] "\nYes.

In the \nfirst part I’m using this G-chord basically …[shows]. At the beginning \n…[music]. And ending in this G …[music]. And now I made the big chord of\n G while going down with a melody.

That’s a philosophical side of the harp and of music \ngenerally."] "\n" [:p {} "So I started studying classical guitar at music school. But then I \nwas fascinated by hearing Derek Bell playing. That was when I was 20 \nyears old, and I realised I was really attracted to the harp. So I saved\n some money and bought my first harp, which was a neo-Irish harp. But \nwithout any teacher I had to do the work by myself. From the very \nbeginning, I adopted the natural position in which all the historical \nharps are being played, not the classical or pedal harp position. \nNaturally I was playing like that – it was an instinctive. I kept going \non that instrument. At the same time as I was learning the technique and\n tunes, I was listening very much to Derek Bell and Allison Kinnaird. As\n I listened I was going deeper and deeper into that older tradition.

With all \nthese museum harps, the spacing between the bass strings is narrower \nthan the rest of the harp and this is what I wanted, an instrument \nabsolutely faithful to the original. In the 1990s Kortier was not yet \nusing this varying spacing between bass strings."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Does the Lamont have the full joint at the base of the fore-pillar, that we can tell exactly where the lowest note was?"] [:br {}] "\nYes."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "That’s a little different to the " [:em {} "Trinity, "] "for which we don’t actually know what that angle was, or how the lowest note was strung."] [:br {}] "\nAh right."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "For the bass strings below the G’s of " [:em {} "na comhluí"] " the spacing is quite a bit narrower than for the treble strings above " [:em {} "na comhluí"] ".

Accurate replicas have narrower spacing between strings in \nthe bass. Evidence suggests that when making holes in the neck for the \ntuning-pins, makers in the old days kept the same distance between them.\n Consequently, due to the higher elevation of the neck where the bass \nstrings go, the spacing between the bass strings was different – \nnarrower – than the rest of the strings. This makes playing more \ndifficult – especially if you are blind as was commonplace for the old \nharpers – as it destroys the uniform distance of intervals like the \noctave, a fundamental interval to have in the memory of the fingers. To \ncorrect this anomaly they – most probably the musicians – added an extra\n string precisely where it was most effective – right above the highest \nbass string which had a narrower spacing, and closer to the normal \nspacing area. In this way for a harp starting in GG all the bass octaves\n were then equal to the rest of the harp."] "\n" [:p {} "This is my opinion, an opinion based on my own experience with the \ninstrument.

And the other \nmystery is that from the very beginning the early Irish harp was played \non the left shoulder. This is quite original in the sense that all the \nharps in the world are played on the right shoulder, as usually 95% of \nthe people are right handed. So why was this harp played on the left \nshoulder, using the left hand to play the melody, and with the right \nplaying the bass? I have my own theory for this also, and if you like I \ncan explain."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Please do!"] [:br {}] "\nOK. I do not make any publications or articles, and so this could be a \ngood chance to explain myself. I always say to new people coming to me \nto study, that playing with the harp on the left-shoulder was the way it\n was played, that it was the tradition in the old days. So if you play \non the left shoulder, wonderful. My explanation for this particular way \nof playing – resting the harp on the left shoulder – is not a technique \nthat is demanded by the instrument in itself. It can equally well be \nplayed on the right side also. Instead, I believe that playing on the \nleft shoulder started with musicians from the lyre tradition. I’ll try \nto explain this. As we can see on stone crosses for instance, we know \nthat before the triangular harp was created, say a thousand years ago, \nthe stringed instrument in Ireland and in Scotland was the lyre. For \ncenturies, in a hereditary way within a family, that was the stringed \ninstrument that professional musicians were playing. How? As in Greece \nand everywhere. As you know a lyre is an instrument with a U-shape. It \nhas more or less seven strings. So it is natural for a right handed \nperson to hold one arm of the lyre with the left hand and to pluck the \nstrings with the right hand. This means that in a natural way, the lyre \nis resting on the left side of the body as you play."] "\n" [:p {} "So now, you need to imagine a lyre player. Let’s say in the south of \nIreland, around Cork. During many previous generations in the family, \nactually for centuries, they were playing the lyre the way I was saying.\n But now imagine one day a person suddenly arrived to the south of \nIreland with a new instrument, the harp. This new instrument was \nprobably smaller than this 15th century Lamont instrument, and probably \nwith less strings. So the natural answer to the new triangular \ninstrument was to hold the instrument by the pillar with the left hand \nand rest it on the left side of the body while using the right hand to \nplay perhaps sixteen strings or so. Over the years the harps were \nincreasing in size and number of strings, but they kept playing in that \nposition, and naturally if you are holding the harp on the left the next\n thing to do if you use two hands is to use the left hand for the \ntreble, and the right hand for the bass. In playing the harp on the left\n shoulder it would be impractical or illogical to use the right hand for\n the treble and the left for the bass. Likewise, on the right shoulder \nwould be unnatural to use the left for the treble and the right for the \nbass. So the position of the hands is determined by the shoulder you’re \nplaying on, and that shoulder, in this case the left, is determined by a\n tradition of centuries of lyre players who used the left side of their \nbodies to rest the lyre on."] "\n" [:p {} "Most probably the first harp players in Ireland also played the lyre.\n Or if not, they abandoned the lyre just as they adopted the new \ninstrument. So they were musicians changing their instrument but not \ntheir profession. It was only natural for them to keep playing the new \ninstrument resting on the same shoulder. And as you know Irish \ntraditional culture is very conservative in the good sense of the word. \nSo if something was working they kept it that way – in this case playing\n on the left."] "\n" [:p {} "Regarding recovering the old technique, the point I made earlier is \nworth repeating. Any technique has to be demanded by the instrument. For\n example, the early Irish harp has metal strings, and that means we need\n fingernails to play. The spacing between the strings is such that we \nare not going to play as we would the classical harp. Instead we adopt \nthis more natural hand shape with the fingers pointing directly to the \nstrings. Metal strings mean the sound will sustain for a long time, so \nwe also need the technique of selective damping. So the answer to many \ntechnical questions comes directly from the instrument."] "\n" [:p {} "All that said, the instrument in itself does not insist, does not \ndemand of any player “you have to play me on the left or on the right”. \nThis is a secondary question. It is a cultural approach to the \ninstrument. The fact that you are playing on the left doesn’t mean that \nyou are playing better. You’ll be a good player if you follow the \ntechnical demands of the instrument and if you keep yourself close to \nthe musical style – ornaments, arrangements, etc. – of the repertoire."] "\n" [:p {} "The instrument is created to produce music, and what I want to hear \nis the music. If it is beautiful music. I don’t mind if it is played on \nthe left or right shoulder. At least that is my approach. So I explain \nall this to all my new students – the tradition is to play on the left. \nIf you play on the left, wonderful – I will admire this – though \nobviously it is more difficult for a right handed person. But it doesn’t\n mean you are going to play better. It means that your approach to the \ninstrument is following that cultural tradition. So that is my way to \nlook at this second mystery."] "\n"

Playing \nfiddle music you tune the four strings on your fiddle as best you can, \nand you can adjust the intonation of the notes as you go through the \npiece so that you are in tune.

Funnily enough, at the beginning of the 17th century in \nEngland, the time of King James I of England (also known as King James \nVI of Scotland), the British flag was first created with four quarters, \nfour different objects representing each nation. The harp was selected \nas the symbol of Ireland. That was met with a lot of opposition from \nsome parts of the aristocracy, because they didn’t like to have a harp \non the flag. Apparently one of the more light-hearted reasons given – to\n provide comic relief – was that it took longer to tune the harp than to\n conquer the land!"] "\n" [:p {} "Tuning an early Irish harp is much more complicated to tune than say a\n gut strung Renaissance harp.

It will still come\n down in pitch, so you will likely need to tune again!"] "\n" [:p {} "The first step in learning to tune is to develop the ear and to know \nwhen something is out of tune. This means the level of perfection in the\n tuning develops with the ears of the musician."] "\n" [:p {} "Then it is good to concentrate on the central octave, tuning the \nnotes one by one, and with intervals. From there working in octaves \ntoward the bass or the treble. And then checking also the octaves of the\n bass strings related to the treble. Then checking by playing chords all\n through the range of strings because sometimes these chords are in tune\n here in one register, but not in another."] "\n" [:p {} "In any case, it is important to know that the stability of the tuning\n depends a lot on temperature and humidity. That is why for a concert it\n is highly recommended for the harp to be in place well in advance to \nsettle, and tuning there."] "\n" [:p {} "All that said, there is no perfect system of tuning on a harmonic \ninstruments like the harp or the piano. On a melodic instrument this \nproblem doesn’t exist but on a harp or a piano you play at the same time\n different notes on different intervals so a compromise or adjustment \nhas to be made. Modern Equal Temperament started systematically with \nBach and Couperin during the first half of 18th century. However there \nare other, earlier systems of tuning. Personally, I use the mean tone \nsystem, the most used in the 16th/17th centuries."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Can you explain more about this mean tone system? When you \nmention the historical context of the music being important, I think the\n historical context of tuning is something that is also worth \nunderstanding when you are learning or arranging these pieces. "] [:br {}] "\nThe mean tone system was created in the Renaissance, because the new \nthing then was the massive use of the third to create what we understand\n today as a chord. By chord, I mean the combination of a note along with\n the third and fifth above that note. That third of the chord was not \nused in the middle ages where they prefer to play fifths and fourths and\n in fact that third sounds quite dissonant in the Pythagorean tuning \nsystem employed in that period. Instead this Pythagorean system gives \nyou perfect fifths and fourths. However for the modern harmony that was \nstarting to develop in the Renaissance, the third was fundamental. The \nmean tone system was taking great care with the third, in giving a pure \nthird, and sixth. So it all depends. Then Bach and Couperin arrived at \nthe beginning of the 18th century with the conclusion that Equal \nTemperament was the best – all semitones exactly the same. In this way \nnothing is pure except the octave."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "What you’re saying about developing your ear, that is the main point, isn’t it?"] [:br {}] "\nIt is. It is, absolutely."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "And listening to the instrument itself"] [:br {}] "\nYes, the tuning by octaves is the best. Sometimes when tuning in the \nbass if I play the note not with the nail but with the flesh, it gives a\n more rounded sound. So it is a question that develops with your ear, \nwith your capacity. Of course there are people who have this gift, they \nhave this pure ear to detect the tone of a mosquito flying – they can \nsay “that’s F sharp”!"] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "I think it is important that you have touched on Equal \nTemperament, and then talking about mean tone systems, and Pythagorean \nsystems. Because we have grown up with Equal Temperament. Pianos in \nEqual Temperament are considered “in tune”, but they’re not – instead \nall notes are equally out of tune. So it may be helpful to understand \nthat our ears have been trained to a different system, probably less \nappropriate to the early Irish harp."]] "\n" [:p {} "I started playing with the Equal Temperament tuning but I was not \nhappy for I was listening other early music players, though not \nparticularly on the harp, and I could here there beautiful chords, very \npure compared to the normal system. Happily some years ago, Siobhán \nArmstrong helped me to definitively move over to the mean tone system. \nOf course the piano sounds good – it’s a compromise and I don’t want to \nsound snobbish – it’s wonderful. But the only thing that is pure on \nmodern instruments with Equal Temperament are the octaves, everything \nelse is moved a little as you were saying."] "\n" [:p {} " "] "\n"

        [:h2 {} "MANUSCRIPT &amp; PRINTED SOURCES"] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Another area which would be interesting to touch upon is the \nsources of the early Gaelic, or early Irish and Scottish harp music. \nCould you talk about the Neal collection – how you first discovered it? "]] "\n" [:p {} "John and William Neal’s publication in 1724 in Dublin was the first \nprinted collection of Irish music. And still to me it is the best \nprinted source because it was made at a time when harpers were still \naround. This is very important. We have a similar case with the Scottish\n lute manuscripts from the first half of the 17th century. Those \nmanuscripts were written while the harp was being played in Scotland. So\n this means the harp tunes that are contained in the Scottish lute \nmanuscripts were heard directly from the harp players just like Bunting \nat the Belfast harp meeting in 1792 and his sessions with Denis \nO’Hampsey. But yeah, the John and William Neal publication of Irish \nmusic is a little collection, but there are many harp tunes there. Just \nthe melodies though, with no bass."] "\n" [:p {} "And then the other fundamental source in early Irish harp music is \nBunting – not the printed books, but the manuscripts which have no piano\n arrangements imposed yet, and are more faithful to the original music \nheard from the living harpers."] "\n" [:p {} "Those are the main sources though we have sources in Scotland and \nIreland from lets say the end of the 16th to the end of the 18th century\n – that is 2 centuries. What I want to make clear here is that during \nthese two centuries, the style of the music was changing. If we take the\n lute tradition, for example the very famous English lute player John \nDowland at the beginning of the 17th century, we could see that the \nmusic he was playing has nothing to do in style with let’s say Sylvius \nLeopold Weiss and others lute players in Germany during the first half \nof the 18th century. The style is completely different, but it is the \nsame tradition and basically the same instrument modified in size and \nnumber of strings."] "\n" [:p {} "What I mean is that if you take music from Rory Dall Ó Catháin – the \nIrish harper at the beginning of the 17th century – the three or four \ntunes we know were composed by him have nothing to do in style with \nCarolan music. But it does not mean that Carolan music is inferior – no,\n it is the same tradition, but in a different moment – the style is \nchanging, but there remain things in common too. Some people think that \nRory Dall Ó Catháin music is the real thing and that Carolan has baroque\n influences and so is inferior somehow – no, it is all " [:em {} "cláirseach"] "\n music, but the style is changing, it is not always the same. So if we \nare working with 18th century sources, it is very good to have knowledge\n of the Baroque music language because it was an influence on the music \nof Carolan and others like Cornelius Lyons. So it helps if you have an \near and a knowledge of the Baroque style played on the continent and \nalso in Ireland because here purely Baroque music was played too."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "What period of music influences your minimal approach to accompaniment the most?"] [:br {}] "\nIn general I always like to say that the music of the early Irish harp –\n and it’s the same in Scotland – is very melodic, and the bass could be \nunderstood as a kind of ornament to the melody, an effective way to \nsustain and give more meaning to the melody."] "\n" [:p {} "If you take Carolan tunes from the wonderful Dónal O’Sullivan \ncollection published in the 1950s, you’ll find there a lot of melodies \nthat need to be arranged and for that you would need to have a sense of \nharmony. If you play just the melody it is very easy, I think, to find \nthe chords. Especially for O’Carolan tunes which are more Baroque in \nstyle, or using major and minor scales, which are the basis for our \nmodern musical language, not different from the Beatles or John Lennon."] "\n" [:p {} "So from the melody it is very easy to find the chords and many \nplayers often arrive at the same chord – I mean “that’s the chord!”. For\n purely modal music it is a different language. So the first thing to \nask is “what are the bones of this melody?”. It may be a major / minor \ntune, or it could be a modal tune in Dorian or Mixalydian, etc. In the \nfirst case it helps a lot to have Baroque or classical harmony teaching.\n I always teach my students to know this difference, to be able know how\n it is the inner scale that sustains the melody and from there it is \neasier to start to work on the arrangements."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "So if you have a modal piece, how do approach the arrangement?"] [:br {}] "\nThis early Irish harp is an instrument for which that famous phrase \n“less is more” is quite true. So you need to take care with ornaments. \nThey are there to give more meaning and beauty to the melody. But if you\n use too many, you will destroy the whole thing!"] "\n" [:p {} "So I have been reducing my use of ornaments, being more austere. That\n said I still use ornaments, because it is part of the tradition of the \nharp.  But it is important not to become obsessed with the \ninstrument in itself, forgetting that, beautiful as it is, it is just a \nmedium. To remember that it is just a means to create music, which \nshould always be the main aim."] "\n" [:p {} "If I take my own playing evolution – at the very beginning, in the \n1990s, I was very enthusiastically following something we knew at that \ntime and that we still know, that ornamentation was very important with \nthis music. And that is ok. But with time and experience I have reduced \nmy focus on ornaments – not using them systematically throughout a \npiece, but only on the very important points of the melody."] "\n" [:p {} "Sometimes as musicians, we have a tendency to add many things, and in\n doing that we are concealing the melody. Of course you can take one \ntune and make many arrangements with different levels of difficulty – \nsome easy, some more complicated. Sometimes the easier arrangements are \nthe best, just like with ornamentation – being overly complex can \ndestroy the expression of the melody."] "\n" [:p {} "Very often – and this is the same with Scottish music – the bass it \nis just a duplication of the important points or notes in the melody, \nplaying an octave or two below. Or perhaps a fifth or a tenth below. \nThat is all you need, basically. Then you can play with some ornaments \non the accented points of the melody as we do when we speak. It is a \nwork of spirit. When you arrive at something that works, you know it. \nSometimes an arrangement can take years, other times you can make an \narrangement in two days, and that’s just how it is."] "\n" [:p {} "For example, I have been playing Molly McAlpin by Connellan for two decades, and it has kept changing."

        [:h2 {} "Composing new pieces in the old tradition"] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Javier, I know you have thoughts on composing new pieces to \nadd to the body of old music in the manuscripts.

But I also believe that if you get a deep understanding of this\n tradition and if you feel like composing something new – being sure \nthat you are following the style – why not work in that direction to \ncreate such new music? In this emerging revival of the old tradition, I \nthink that could be a step for the next generations. Not only to recover\n –  the whole work we have been doing in last 30 years, the \ntechnique, the sources and all that – but also, with all that knowledge,\n to create new tunes that follow the tradition of the instrument. That \nwould be a very interesting thing to do! And that would make the \ninstrument more alive."] "\n" [:p {} "In this the early Irish harp is different from the lute. We have lute\n music from the beginning of the 16th century to the end of the 18th but\n the lute was an instrument not related to any particular country or \ntradition.

So when the social \ncontext was over in the 18th century, that was it."] "\n" [:p {} "Then in the 20th century some musicians wanted to recover the lute, \nand they played old historical lute music, but they stopped short of \ncreating new music because it wouldn’t make sense, it would be a mere \nexercise. However with the early Irish harp it is different because the \ninstrument is inside a musical tradition that has never been completely \ncut and the proof for this is that the original early Irish harp music \ndoesn’t sound ‘old’ to modern ears in the sense it does lute music. So \nit makes sense to start creating new music for the early Irish harp. To \nme it would not be something artificial – as long as you have all the \nknowledge and background."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Have you composed new pieces in the old tradition yourself?"] [:br {}] "\nYes I have, several.
