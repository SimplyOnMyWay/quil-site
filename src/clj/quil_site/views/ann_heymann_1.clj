The harpers preferred not to play the \n  four-chord which is also known as the chord of the sub-dominant. So\n  in this piece …[music]… the one-chord is G, the dominant chord or \n  five-chord, is D, and the subdominant chord or four-chord is C. In \n  today’s music the four-chord is probably the third most popular chord in\n  major-scale pieces. With the early Irish harpers the E-minor …[music]… \n  instead of this C …[music]… was perhaps the second most popular chord. \n  Edward Bunting says they didn’t really know major and minor, and \n  I’m finding that these sonorities are oftentimes shared in pieces \n  and it gives interest to the music on an instrument that is diatonic, \n  where we don’t have chromatic notes. So, here I’ll go again …[music]… \n  and there’s beauty in hearing the dissonant notes in there instead of \n  changing chords with every change, because the melody creates its own \n  dissonance …[music]." [:br {}] "\n  And here I like breaking it apart. Edward bunting also said – only in \n  his manuscripts does he say this – that the important notes of the \n  melody are played with the bass hand, the right hand, being the \n  strongest in the sonorous range. So I’m doing that a lot, and the \n  important melody notes means that it’s played on the stress and whether \n  it’s a phrase – it doesn’t need to be rhythmically on the stress – \n  but just that it’s a note that receives more stress than a passing \n  note. This is a strong note …[music]… and again a strong one …[music]."] "\n\n\n\n\n\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Would you choose these chords every time you start this piece?"] [:br {}] "\n" [:iframe {:src "https://player.vimeo.com/video/284788669", :allowfullscreen "allowfullscreen", :data-mce-fragment "1", :width "640", :height "360", :frameborder "0"}] [:br {}] "\nThe second or third time through the piece – let’s say it’s a song – I \nmight choose instead to highlight …[music]… can you hear that \nchord?

[:br {}] "\n[music]…" [:br {}] "\nNow that …[music]… is part of the B-minor chord, and if we are now \nconsidering the piece as in E-minor then the E-minor chord is now the \none-chord, and the five-chord is the B-minor. And it begs the question –\n how early were these things done? When Cambrensis mentions modulation \nback in the 1100’s for the Irish harp, was that what he meant? It’s\n very fun to look back at what he might mean, and I’m only suggesting \none possibility for that (laughing)! [music]…I could do that (G \nchord), or the B-minor on the melody D note – those are choices \n…[music]… and that makes the music more interesting."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "Can you show how you continue into the second part of the Jointure?"] [:br {}] "\n" [:iframe {:src "https://player.vimeo.com/video/284959010", :allowfullscreen "allowfullscreen", :data-mce-fragment "1", :width "640", :height "360", :frameborder "0"}] [:br {}] "\nOK, in the second part of the tune, I think most people would probably \ndo this …[music]… a D-chord. I don’t want that – that’s the five-chord \nfrom the G-major mode – it doesn’t…the harp doesn’t speak to me, the \nmode doesn’t speak to me. So I start …[music]… here’s the B-minor, the \nfive-chord-y there, if we think of this part as being in an E-minor \nmode. And now this …[music]… I can just hit the melody there. And now \n…[music]… this is the two-chord. And it’s interesting when Bunting, at \nthe beginning of his 1840 volume, he analyzes music, song melodies, and \npoints out the importance of the major sixth in the melodies. So in G \nthe major sixth, this E tone …[music]… he says they didn’t play this \nG-chord with it, but the E-minor …[music].  Bunting says that this \nis the prominent feature of Irish music. I don’t have the name of \nthe person but not long after Bunting published in 1840, it was reviewed\n by a university professor who blasts him on this point saying that\n it is not really true because it’s popular in other places – Scotland \nand Wales. This instrument, and the culture – the Gaelic culture – of \ncourse is shared into Scotland. The harpers traveled freely. This piece \nwas composed by Connellan who was Irish and lived in Scotland, so that’s\n no surprise."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "So the major sixth would have been a common feature in Scotland as well?"] [:br {}] "\nYes, and I see pieces from Scotland – big pieces – that are major. It’s \nkind of interesting that they are laments because they’re very major-y. \nBut if you’re doing variations – it might begin in G …[music]… and then a\n melody comes in on E, and so I’ll do variations on that. So I’m finding\n how this works for the other pieces as well. It is \nabout developing a taste and flavor."] "\n" [:p {} "Anyhow we’re in the turning of " [:em {} "the Jointure"] ", so instead of \n…[music]… I’m more like this …[music]. With the melody alone …[music]… \nand now I’m putting a harmony with this …[music]… so you hear the \nmelody itself creates some of the harmony but you do need to add some \nharmony notes with this melody. [music]… the melody is going minor \nhere. And then here again, this is …[music]."] "\n" [:p {} [:strong {} "You seem to have a preference to play major and minor in different ranges of the harp.

If I’m playing up here in the treble it’s really\n nice …[music]…" [:br {}] "\nBut you can get stuck, hung out to dry, by this bass ringing. How are \nyou going to get rid of it? So when you do play the low notes you \nhave to be able to stop them if you need to. Usually that will be needed\n when the chord changes, whether it’s major or minor. Unless if it’s in \nG, or if it is in mixolydian mode …[music]. Our ears are used to that – \nthat’s like a bagpipe drone going on with it. So the mixolydian mode is \nvery friendly for a drone chord. Other modes aren’t so friendly that \nway. Dorian mode is also friendly for droning. I’m seeing a lot of the \nmusic being expressed only with with two chords, but this piece of \nConnellan’s really requires more than two chords. Sometimes the chords \nare, as I’ll say, the one and five. One being on whatever the tonic is. \nSo …[music]… that’s between the one and five, easy to play.
